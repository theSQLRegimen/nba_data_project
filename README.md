The nba_stat Database

This relational database was designed using data modeling best practices. As a Database Administrator, I developed this project from scratch—from the initial data model through to the queries and stored procedures used to interact with the database. This project showcases my skills as both a Data Modeler and Database Administrator.

The database contains player statistics and the complete game schedule for the 2025-2026 NBA season. By analyzing historical data, we can gain insights into future player and team performance
